    <p>A cache memory implementation.</p>

### Introduction

Cache was the name chosen to represent the level of the memory hierarchy between the processor and main memory. It consists of a small, fast memory that acts as a buffer for the DRAM memory, and is built using a different memory technology, static random access memory (SRAM). (from the book Computer Organization and Design, by David Patterson).
